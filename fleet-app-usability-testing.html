                Fleet is a mobile app developed by the Baltimore-based software entrepreneurship company MasT (an abbreviation of “Massive Transparency”). Fleet accounts typically are initiated by membership organizations. Fleet clients (membership organizations) can then invite their members to create accounts and use Fleet to maintain an organization calendar and groups. As a full CRM/ERP system, the primary goal is for the organization to collect better data about their membership so as to create and deliver more value toward the organization’s mission, and for member users to have greater control over their own data within the organization.

                We differentiate between administrator end users and member end users. Administrator users manage the organization’s calendar, groups, and marketplace and use the app to check members into events and sell merchandise. Member end users are empowered by Fleet to manage their membership status (i.e. check whether active, renew, etc.), view upcoming events and meetings and add to their calendar, view and contact organization groups or committees (where applicable), and make other purchases such as event tickets and organization swag. Fleet calls it, “the whole organization, in your pocket.”

                The purpose of the present usability study is to assist the client (Fleet by MasT co-founder) and his team in achieving their vision of supporting membership organizations’ missions through better data collection and constituent management but investigating the needs of users and advocating for the users.
                The primary usability goals of our client are ease of navigation and carrying out fundamental tasks. Our assessment to this point addresses these goals and identifies additional needs and priorities voiced by user participants and discovered during our evaluation.

                Tina is a 35-year-old woman. She got married a couple years ago and does not have children. She is energetic and passionate about her career as an urban planner and was recently promoted to senior management. She wakes up early each morning to take her dog, Betty, for a walk in the park and to think about her goals for the day.
                Typically, Tina heads to the office earlier than her colleagues so that she can dip out for outside meetings when she needs to, which is frequently because she is affiliated with a number of causes and projects. She is often asked to take on leadership positions, which she considers carefully, as she guards her time well.
                Tina has volunteered with a community group dedicated to maintaining her local park for several years now and currently serves on the Board of Directors. She attends a few other community meetings each month in order to stay current on her neighborhood and city and gives back using her professional skills whenever she can. It’s a lot of work, and even though she loves it, she has to be careful not to burn out. Sometimes she wishes there was a way to make the smaller tasks easier so she could spend her time on high-impact projects.
                She is an active member of her professional organization. Her social life and professional/volunteer life overlap dramatically: after-work happy hours with friends double as planning meetings for the park or brainstorming sessions for a potential urban planning contract.
                Tina loves traveling, taking weekend trips around the US whenever she can sneak away. She spends whatever other free time she has--maybe an hour or so in the evenings--reading the latest bestselling fiction. Thankfully, her husband loves to cook, and she cherishes the time they get to spend together over dinner, even if it usually isn’t until 8 or 9 PM!

                We made an effort to keep the “look and feel” of our redesign consistent between versions. This way, when we test the designs on users, we will find out how functional differences--which are at the root of our research questions--impact usability and experience. We used Google’s Material Design design language to create a simple look and feel similar to that of the current app.
